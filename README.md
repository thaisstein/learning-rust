# Learning Rust 🦀

This repository documents my progress through the Rust programming language. It's roughly a collection of solved [exercises](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) and synthesized notes based on the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/).

## Content
- `exercises-rust-by-example.md`: Walkthrough and explanations on the coding [exercises](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) solutions and notes on what I understood from each topic.
- `exercises`: A folder for all my topic-based practice work.
